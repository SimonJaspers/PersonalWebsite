#About

I'm a product designer specialized in software. I love to design and build software products that help people solve problems. 

To design something that fits its context, I've got to get to know the people that will use the products I design.


For me, design is about people. It's about who they are, what they think, what they can and cannot do. It concerns their problems and the things they love, their previous experiences and current curiosities.


Almost every day I pedal my bike to work. Tail wind in the morning makes my day and gets me there five minutes earlier.
