<h1>About</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m a product designer specialized in software. I love to design and build software products that help people solve problems.</p>

<p>To design something that fits its context, I&rsquo;ve got to get to know the people that will use the products I design.</p>

<p>For me, design is about people. It&rsquo;s about who they are, what they think, what they can and cannot do. It concerns their problems and the things they love, their previous experiences and current curiosities.</p>

<p>Almost every day I pedal my bike to work. Tail wind in the morning makes my day and gets me there five minutes earlier.</p>
