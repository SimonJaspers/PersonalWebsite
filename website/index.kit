		<p class="intro">
			I'm <strong>Simon</strong>. I live in Rotterdam and work in Delft. The guy in that big picture above this short introduction, that's me.
		</p>
		<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
		<p>
			This website is mainly about me having some digital presence. Since I spend about eight to ten hours a day designing and building products that live on the Internet, I thought it would be nice if Google knew my name.
		</p>
		<p>
			So yeah... Some personal information, a short intro/bio, nothing fancy. Please, <em><a href="mailto:simon.jaspers@gmail.com">contact me</a></em> if there's anything you'd like to know.

		<h1>What I do</h1>
		<p>
			I'm an interaction designer. That means I design interactions between products and their users. I try to get to know everything I can about the people I design for. Researching their experiences, thoughts, problems and surroundings gives me the ability to not just create a product that <em>works</em>, but to shape a fitting interaction between a product and a person.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm currently working on an awesome web app, <strong>Mapiq</strong>. My work ranges from determining the product's functionalities to front-end Javascript coding.
		</p>
		<h1>What I've been up to</h1>
		<h2>Industrial Design Engineering</h2>
		<p>
			I spent three years studying Industrial Design Engineering in which I hold a Bachelor of Science degree. Those three years thought me a lot about solving problems in structured design processes. But more importantly, they awoke a burning interest in the ways products influence people's lives.
		</p>
		<h2>Design for Interaction</h2>
		<p>
			This interest led me to my second study choice: in 2013 I obtained an engineering degree in Design for Interaction. I learnt there's more to product design than coming up with the most efficient and cost-effective solution to a problem.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>
		  	Design for Interaction focuses on the way in which people and products interact. How does a user experience and use a product? What is his understanding of that product? And is it the design of the product that determines or influences these responses, the needs and abilities of the user, or the environment in which it is used and its social context?
